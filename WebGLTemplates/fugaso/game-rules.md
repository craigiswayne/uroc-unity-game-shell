## <div style="text-align:center;color:#ffcc00">About the Game</div>

#{game_name} is a casino game that consists of a 3x3 grid of tiles that rotate each spin.

The middle horizontal row is a single win line that must be full to trigger the Hold For Gold game.
Icons that appear on any other positions on the game board only trigger if this win line is full.


Once triggered, the player has three (3) opportunities to hit another symbol in any
of the blank positions to continue winning. 
If an additional symbol is spun into play, the counter is reset to 3 and play continues.



If the player runs out of spins, the Hold For Gold game is over and the player collects all the
amounts on the screen. Good luck!

### Start the game
Start by setting bet value and choosing
number of mines between 1 and 24. The maximum potential win for the chosen combination

panel.


### Jackpot Triggers
There are teeth and mines under the tiles.
Click on any tile to reveal a tooth, and with each tooth found your total winnings

the round.


### Beware the mines
If you happen upon a mine, your progress
thus far is lost. The game ends and you can start over.



### Mechanics of the game
The following sections explain the underlying mechanics of the
game. The base of all mine games is that there are TEETH and MINES. Teeth award
a multiplier to the player's bet, while mines result in the player's loss of
the bet.
